## Exercise 6- Creating **Input Controls** for the dashboard

This exercise focusses on creating "Input Controls" for the dashboard to filter the data displayed on the dashboard. Input Controls allow users to interact with the dashboard and dynamically change the data displayed based on their preferences.

To complete this challenge, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the appropriate fields to be used for filtering, such as "SalesOrganization" and "OrderCreationMonth".
2. Choose the appropriate type of input controls i.e. a drop-down list.
3. Configure the input controls to interact with the dashboard's data sources. This can be done by mapping the input control to the appropriate fields in the data source.
4. Set up the input control to provide options to the users to filter the data. For example, if the input control is a drop down list, the user should be able to select a specific values to view data.


Your objective is to create input controls that allow users to filter the data displayed on the dashboard based on their preferences, such as selecting a specific sales organization or Order Creation Month. The input controls should be intuitive and easy to use, and should be designed to enhance the user's experience and facilitate their decision-making process. Best of luck!
